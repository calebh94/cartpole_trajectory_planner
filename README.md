# Cartpole Trajectory planner
## Overview
A Comparison of trajectory planners, control techniques, and problem 
formulations for the cartpole system (and other dynamical systems in 
future)

## Current Methods
*Nonlinear Model Predictive Control solving Hamiltonian, two-point 
boundary value problem
